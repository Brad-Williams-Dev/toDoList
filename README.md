## Simple To-Do List App for Learning React Native

This is a simple To-Do List application built using React Native and Expo CLI. It serves as a first app for exploring React Native and understanding the basic concepts and components used in mobile application development.

## Features

- Easy-to-use interface: This app offers a clean and straightforward UI, making it simple for users to interact with.
- Add tasks: Users can quickly add tasks to their to-do list by typing in the input field and tapping the "Add" button.
- Delete tasks: Users can remove tasks from their to-do list by simply tapping on the task they wish to delete.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide myself a hands-on introduction to React Native. Through building a simple To-Do List app, I can familiarize myself with the fundamentals of React Native, including components, state management, and event handling. Additionally, this project demonstrates how to use the StyleSheet for styling components and the FlatList component for rendering lists. By working on this project, I was able to develop a solid foundation for further exploration of React Native and mobile app development.
